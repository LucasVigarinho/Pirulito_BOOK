 * angle a in radians between 0 and 2p, as shown in Figure 4.7b and the point determined
 * by this angle is (r*cos(a), r*sin(a)).)

 * (a) A triangle is formed from three random points on the circle. (b) A random
 * point on the circle can be generated using a random angle a. (c) A pentagon is centered at
 * (0, 0) with one point at the 0 o’clock position.

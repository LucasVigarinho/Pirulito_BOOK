 * (Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon in
 * which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e., the
 * polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the area
 * of a regular polygon is
 *  
 *  	         						  2
 *						 		     5 * S
 * 							Area = ------------ 
 *								  4 * tan(PI/n)
 *
 * Here, s is the length of a side. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 * number of sides and their length of a regular polygon and displays its area. Here is
 * a sample run:

/**

 * (Geometry: area of a hexagon) The area of a hexagon can be computed using the
 * following formula (s is the length of a side):
 * 
 *  	         						  2
 *						 		     5 * S
 * 							Area = ------------ 
 *								  4 * tan(PI/6)
 *  
 *  
 *  Write a program that prompts the user to enter the side of a hexagon and displays
 *  its area. Here is a sample run:
 *  
 *  
 *  Enter the side: 5.5
 *  The area of the hexagon is 78.59

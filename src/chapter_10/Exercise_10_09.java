/** 
 * 			
 * 		(The Course class) Revise the Course class as follows:
 * 		■ The array size is fixed in Listing 10.6. Improve it to automatically increase
 * 		the array size by creating a new larger array and copying the contents of the
 * 		current array to it.
 * 		■ Implement the dropStudent method.
 * 		■ Add a new method named clear() that removes all students from the
 * 		course.
 * 		Write a test program that creates a course, adds three students, removes one,
 * 		and displays the students in the course.

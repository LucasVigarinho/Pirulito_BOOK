/** 
 * 			
 * 	(Approximate e) Programming Exercise 5.26 approximates e using the following
 * 	series:
 * 		
 * 			e = 1 + (1/1!) + (1/2!) + (1/3!) + (1/4!) + ... + (1/n!)			
 * 
 * 	In order to get better precision, use BigDecimal with 25 digits of precision in
 * 	the computation. Write a program that displays the e value for i = 100, 200, . . . ,
 * 	and 1000.

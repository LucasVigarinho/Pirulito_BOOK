/** 
 * 		(Displaying the prime factors) Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * 		a positive integer and displays all its smallest factors in decreasing order. For
 * 		example, if the integer is 120, the smallest factors are displayed as 5, 3, 2, 2,
 * 		2. Use the StackOfIntegers class to store the factors (e.g., 2, 2, 2, 3, 5) and
 * 		retrieve and display them in reverse order.

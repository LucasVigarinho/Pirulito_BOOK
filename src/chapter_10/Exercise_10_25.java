/** 
 * 			
 * 	(New string split method) The split method in the String class returns an
 * 	array of strings consisting of the substrings split by the delimiters. However, the
 * 	delimiters are not returned. Implement the following new method that returns
 * 	an array of strings consisting of the substrings split by the matching delimiters,
 * 	including the matching delimiters.
 * 	
 * 	public static String[] split(String s, String regex)
 * 
 * 	For example, split("ab#12#453", "#") returns ab, #, 12, #, 453 in an
 * 	array of String, and split("a?b?gf#e", "[?#]") returns a, b, ?, b, gf,
 * 	#, and e in an array of String.

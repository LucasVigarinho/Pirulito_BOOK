 * (Mersenne prime) A prime number is called a Mersenne prime if it can be written
 * in the form 2p - 1 for some positive integer p. Write a program that finds
 * all Mersenne primes with p … 100 and displays the output as shown below.
 * (Hint: You have to use BigInteger to store the number, because it is too big to
 * be stored in long. Your program may take several hours to run.)

/**
 * 
 * 
 * 		(Geometry: area of a regular polygon) A regular polygon is an n-sided polygon
 * 		in which all sides are of the same length and all angles have the same degree (i.e.,
 * 		the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). The formula for computing the
 * 		area of a regular polygon is
 *		  										     2
 *		  								Area = (n x S ) / (4 x tan(pi/n))
 *
 *		Write a method that returns the area of a regular polygon using the following header:
 *
 *		public static double area(int n, double side)
 *
 *		Write a main method that prompts the user to enter the number of sides and the
 *		side of a regular polygon and displays its area. Here is a sample run:
 *
 *		Enter the number of sides: 5
 *		Enter the side: 6.5
 *		The area of the polygon is 72.69017017488385

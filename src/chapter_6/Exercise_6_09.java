 * 		(Conversions between feet and meters) Write a class that contains the following
 * 		two methods:
 * 
 * 		// Convert from feet to meters 
 * 		public static double footToMeter(double foot)
 * 
 * 		// Convert from meters to feet 
 * 		public static double meterToFoot(double meter)
 * 
 * 		The formula for the conversion is:
 * 
 * 		meter = 0.305 * foot
 * 		foot = 3.279 * meter
 * 
 * 		Write a test program that invokes these methods to display the following tables:
 * 		
 * 		Feet Meters | Meters Feet
 * 		1.0   0.305 | 20.0   65.574
 * 		2.0   0.610 | 25.0   81.967
 * 		...
 * 		9.0   2.745 | 60.0  196.721
 * 		10.0  3.050 | 65.0  213.115

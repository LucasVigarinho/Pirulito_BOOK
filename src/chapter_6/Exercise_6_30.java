/** 
 * 
 * 
 * 		(Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program
 * 		to play a variation of the game, as follows:
 * 
 * 		Roll two dice. Each die has six faces representing values 1, 2, â€¦, and 6, respectively.
 * 		Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called craps), you
 * 		lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value
 * 		(i.e., 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10), a point is established. Continue to roll the dice until either
 * 		a 7 or the same point value is rolled. If 7 is rolled, you lose. Otherwise, you win.
 * 
 * 		Your program acts as a single player. Here are some sample runs.
 * 
 * 		You rolled 5 + 6 = 11
 * 		You win
 * 
 * 
 * 		You rolled 1 + 2 = 3
 * 		You lose
 * 
 * 
 * 		You rolled 4 + 4 = 8
 * 		point is 8
 * 		You rolled 6 + 2 = 8
 * 		You win
 * 
 * 
 * 		You rolled 3 + 2 = 5
 * 		point is 5
 * 		You rolled 2 + 5 = 7
 * 		You lose

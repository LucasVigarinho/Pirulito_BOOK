 * 		(Latin square) A Latin square is an n-by-n array filled with n different Latin letters,
 * 		each occurring exactly once in each row and once in each column. Write a
 * 		program that prompts the user to enter the number n and the array of characters,
 * 		as shown in the sample output, and checks if the input array is a Latin square.
 * 		The characters are the first n characters starting from A.
 * 
 * 		Enter number n: 4
 * 		Enter 4 rows of letters separated by spaces:
 * 		A B C D
 * 		B A D C
 * 		C D B A
 * 		D C A B
 * 		The input array is a Latin square
 * 
 * 		Enter number n: 3
 * 		Enter 3 rows of letters separated by spaces:
 * 		A F D
 * 		Wrong input: the letters must be from A to C

 * 		a sample run:
 * 		
 * 		Enter the number of points: 8
 * 		Enter 8 points: 0 0 1 1 -1 -1 2 2 -2 -2 -3 -3 -4 -4 5 5
 * 		The closest two points are (0.0, 0.0) and (1.0, 1.0)
 * 		The closest two points are (0.0, 0.0) and (-1.0, -1.0)
 * 		The closest two points are (1.0, 1.0) and (2.0, 2.0)
 * 		The closest two points are (-1.0, -1.0) and (-2.0, -2.0)
 * 		The closest two points are (-2.0, -2.0) and (-3.0, -3.0)
 * 		The closest two points are (-3.0, -3.0) and (-4.0, -4.0)
 * 		Their distance is 1.4142135623730951

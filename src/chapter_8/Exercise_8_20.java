 * 
 * 		(Game: connect four) Connect four is a two-player board game in which the
 * 		players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically
 * 		suspended grid, as shown below.		
 * 		
 * 		The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column,
 * 		or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. The program prompts
 * 		two players to drop a red or yellow disk alternately. In the preceding figure, the
 * 		red disk is shown in a dark color and the yellow in a light color. Whenever a disk
 * 		is dropped, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the
 * 		status of the game (win, draw, or continue). Here is a sample run:

/** 
 * 
 * 		(Geometry: area of a triangle) Write a method that returns the area of a triangle
 * 		using the following header:
 * 
 * 		public static double getTriangleArea(double[][] points)
 * 
 * 		The points are stored in a 3-by-2 two-dimensional array points with points[0]
 * 		[0] and points[0][1] for (x1, y1). The triangle area can be computed using the
 * 		formula in Programming Exercise 2.19. The method returns 0 if the three points
 * 		are on the same line. Write a program that prompts the user to enter three points of
 * 		a triangle and displays the triangle's area. Here is a sample run of the program:
 * 		
 * 		Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3: 2.5 2 5 -1.0 4.0 2.0
 * 		The area of the triangle is 2.25
 * 		
 * 		Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3: 2 2 4.5 4.5 6 6
 * 		The three points are on the same line

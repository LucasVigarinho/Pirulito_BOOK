 * 		(Geometry: polygon subareas) A convex 4-vertex polygon is divided into four
 * 		triangles, as shown in Figure 8.9.
 * 		Write a program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of four vertices and
 * 		displays the areas of the four triangles in increasing order. Here is a sample run:
 * 
 * 		Enter x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4:
 * 		-2.5 2 4 4 3 -2 -2 -3.5
 * 		The areas are 6.17 7.96 8.08 10.42

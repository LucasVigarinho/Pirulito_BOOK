/**

 * 		(Algebra: solve linear equations) Write a method that solves the following
 * 		2 * 2 system of linear equations:
 * 		a00x + a01y = b0
 * 		a10x + a11y = b1
 * 		x =
 * 		b0a11 - b1a01
 * 		a00a11 - a01a10
 * 		y =
 * 		b1a00 - b0a10
 * 		a00a11 - a01a10
 * 		The method header is
 * 
 * 		public static double[] linearEquation(double[][] a, double[] b)
 * 
 * 		The method returns null if a00a11 - a01a10 is 0. Write a test program that
 * 		prompts the user to enter a00, a01, a10, a11, b0, and b1, and displays the result. If
 * 		a00a11 - a01a10 is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.” A sample run is
 * 		similar to Programming Exercise 3.3.

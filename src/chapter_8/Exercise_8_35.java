/** 
 * 
 * 		(Largest block) Given a square matrix with the elements 0 or 1, write a program
 * 		to find a maximum square submatrix whose elements are all 1s. Your program
 * 		should prompt the user to enter the number of rows in the matrix. The program
 * 		then displays the location of the first element in the maximum square submatrix
 * 		and the number of the rows in the submatrix. Here is a sample run:
 * 		
 * 		Enter the number of rows in the matrix: 5
 * 		Enter the matrix row by row:
 * 		1 0 1 0 1
 * 		1 1 1 0 1
 * 		1 0 1 1 1
 * 		1 0 1 1 1
 * 		1 0 1 1 1
 * 		The maximum square submatrix is at (2, 2) with size 3
 * 
 * 		Your program should implement and use the following method to find the maximum
 * 		square submatrix:
 * 
 * 		public static int[] findLargestBlock(int[][] m)
 * 
 * 		The return value is an array that consists of three values. The first two values are
 * 		the row and column indices for the first element in the submatrix, and the third
 * 		value is the number of the rows in the submatrix.

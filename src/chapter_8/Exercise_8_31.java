/** 
 * 
 * 		(Geometry: intersecting point) Write a method that returns the intersecting point of
 * 		two lines. The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by using the formula
 * 		shown in Programming Exercise 3.25. Assume that (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the
 * 		two points on line 1 and (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) are on line 2. The method header is
 * 
 * 		public static double[] getIntersectingPoint(double[][] points)
 * 
 * 		The points are stored in a 4-by-2 two-dimensional array points with
 * 		(points[0][0], points[0][1]) for (x1, y1). The method returns the intersecting
 * 		point or null if the two lines are parallel. Write a program that prompts
 * 		the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point. See Programming
 * 		Exercise 3.25 for a sample run.

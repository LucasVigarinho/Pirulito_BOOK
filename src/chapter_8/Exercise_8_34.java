/** 
 * 
 * 		(Geometry: rightmost lowest point) In computational geometry, often you need
 * 		to find the rightmost lowest point in a set of points. Write the following method
 * 		that returns the rightmost lowest point in a set of points.
 * 		public static double[]
 * 
 * 		getRightmostLowestPoint(double[][] points)
 * 
 * 		Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the coordinates of six points
 * 		and displays the rightmost lowest point. Here is a sample run:
 * 
 * 		Enter 6 points: 1.5 2.5 -3 4.5 5.6 -7 6.5 -7 8 1 10 2.5
 * 		The rightmost lowest point is (6.5, -7.0)

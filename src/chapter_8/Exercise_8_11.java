/** 
 * 
 * 		(Game: nine heads and tails) Nine coins are placed in a 3-by-3 matrix with some
 * 		face up and some face down. You can represent the state of the coins using a
 * 		3-by-3 matrix with values 0 (heads) and 1 (tails). Here are some examples:
 * 		
 * 		0 0 0 	1 0 1 	1 1 0 	1 0 1 	1 0 0
 * 		0 1 0 	0 0 1 	1 0 0 	1 1 0 	1 1 1
 * 		0 0 0 	1 0 0 	0 0 1 	1 0 0 	1 1 0
 * 		
 * 
 * 		Each state can also be represented using a binary number. For example, the preceding
 * 		matrices correspond to the numbers
 * 		
 * 		000010000 101001100 110100001 101110100 100111110
 * 		
 * 		There are a total of 512 possibilities, so you can use decimal numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,
 * 		. . . , and 511 to represent all states of the matrix. Write a program that prompts
 * 		the user to enter a number between 0 and 511 and displays the corresponding
 * 		matrix with the characters H and T. Here is a sample run:
 * 		
 * 
 * 		Enter a number between 0 and 511: 7
 * 		H H H
 * 		H H H
 * 		T T T
 * 		
 * 		The user entered 7, which corresponds to 000000111. Since 0 stands for H and
 * 		1 for T, the output is correct.

 * 		(Game: play a tic-tac-toe game) In a game of tic-tac-toe, two players take turns
 * 		marking an available cell in a 3 * 3 grid with their respective tokens (either
 * 		X or O). When one player has placed three tokens in a horizontal, vertical, or
 * 		diagonal row on the grid, the game is over and that player has won. A draw (no
 * 		winner) occurs when all the cells on the grid have been filled with tokens and
 * 		neither player has achieved a win. Create a program for playing tic-tac-toe.
 * 		The program prompts two players to enter an X token and O token alternately.
 * 		Whenever a token is entered, the program redisplays the board on the
 * 		console and determines the status of the game (win, draw, or continue). Here
 * 		is a sample run:

 * 		|   |   |   |
 * 		——————-——————
 * 		|   |   |   |
 * 		——————-——————
 * 		
 * 		Enter a row (0, 1, or 2) for player X: 1
 * 		Enter a column (0, 1, or 2) for player X: 1
 * 		——————-——————

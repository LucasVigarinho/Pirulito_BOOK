/** 
 * 
 * 		(Points nearest to each other) Listing 8.3 gives a program that finds two points in a
 * 		two-dimensional space nearest to each other. Revise the program so that it finds two
 * 		points in a three-dimensional space nearest to each other. Use a two-dimensional
 * 		array to represent the points. Test the program using the following points:
 * 
 * 		double[][] points = {{-1, 0, 3}, {-1, -1, -1}, {4, 1, 1},
 * 		{2, 0.5, 9}, {3.5, 2, -1}, {3, 1.5, 3}, {-1.5, 4, 2},
 * 		{5.5, 4, -0.5}};
 * 		
 * 		The formula for computing the distance between two points (x1, y1, z1) and
 * 		(x2, y2, z2) is 2(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 + (z2 - z1)2.

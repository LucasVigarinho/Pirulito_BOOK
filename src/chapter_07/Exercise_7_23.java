/** 
 * 
 * 		(Game: locker puzzle) A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are
 * 		closed on the first day of school. As the students enter, the first student, denoted
 * 		S1, opens every locker. Then the second student, S2, begins with the second
 * 		locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker. Student S3 begins with the
 * 		third locker and changes every third locker (closes it if it was open, and opens it if
 * 		it was closed). Student S4 begins with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker.
 * 		Student S5 starts with L5 and changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student
 * 		S100 changes L100.
 * 
 * 		After all the students have passed through the building and changed the lockers,
 * 		which lockers are open? Write a program to find your answer and display all
 * 		open locker numbers separated by exactly one space.
 * 
 * 		(Hint: Use an array of 100 Boolean elements, each of which indicates whether a
 * 		locker is open (true) or closed (false). Initially, all lockers are closed.)
 * 		
 * 		     100 lockers and 100 students 
//
//     FIRST  STEP -      ALL LOCKERS ARE CLOSED 		  	-   on the first day of school. 
//	   SECOND STEP -      S1, OPEN EVERY LOCKER.            -   Student 1, open every locker
//     THIRD  STEP -      S2, BEGINS WITH THE LOCKER 2		-   Student 2, closes every other locker.
//	   FOURTH STEP -      S3, BEGINS WITH THE LOCKER 3		-   Student 3, changes every third locker (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed).
//	   FIFTH  STEP -      S4, BEGINS WITH THE LOCKER 4		-   Student 4, changes every fourth locker.
//	   SIXTH  STEP -      S5, BEGINS WITH THE LOCKER 5		-   Student 5, changes every fifth locker.
//					 so on, until student S100 changes L100.

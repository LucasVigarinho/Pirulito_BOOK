/**
 * 
 * (Geometry: two rectangles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 * center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height of two rectangles and determines
 * whether the second rectangle is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown
 * in Figure 3.9. Test your program to cover all cases.
 * 
 * 
 * (a) A rectangle is inside another one. (b) A rectangle overlaps another one.
 * 
 * Here are the sample runs:
 * 
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 2.5 4 2.5 43
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1.5 5 0.5 3
 * r2 is inside r1
 * 
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 5.5
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 3 4 4.5 5
 * r2 overlaps r1
 * 
 * Enter r1's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 1 2 3 3
 * Enter r2's center x-, y-coordinates, width, and height: 40 45 3 2
 * r2 does not overlap r1

/**
 * 
 * (Financial: compare costs) Suppose you shop for rice in two different packages.
 * You would like to write a program to compare the cost. The program prompts the
 * user to enter the weight and price of the each package and displays the one with
 * the better price. Here is a sample run:
 * 
 * Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 24.59
 * Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 11.99
 * Package 2 has a better price.
 * 
 * 
 * Enter weight and price for package 1: 50 25
 * Enter weight and price for package 2: 25 12.5
 * Two packages have the same price.

/**
 * 
 * (Geometry: two circles) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center
 * coordinates and radii of two circles and determines whether the second circle is
 * inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown in Figure 3.10. (Hint: circle2 is
 * inside circle1 if the distance between the two centers 6 = |r1 - r2| and circle2
 * overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers <= r1 + r2. Test your
 * program to cover all cases.)
 * Here are the sample runs:
 * 
 * 
 * Enter circle1's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 0.5 5.1 13
 * Enter circle2's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 1 1.7 4.5
 * circle2 is inside circle1
 * 
 * 
 * (a) A circle is inside another circle. (b) A circle overlaps another circle.
 * 
 * Enter circle1's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 3.4 5.7 5.5
 * Enter circle2's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 6.7 3.5 3
 * circle2 overlaps circle1
 * 
 * Enter circle1's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 3.4 5.5 1
 * Enter circle2's center x-, y-coordinates, and radius: 5.5 7.2 1
 * circle2 does not overlap circle1

/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 		
 * 		(Baby name popularity ranking) The popularity ranking of baby names from
 * 		years 2001 to 2010 is downloaded from www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames and stored
 * 		in files named babynameranking2001.txt, babynameranking2002.txt, . . . ,
 * 		babynameranking2010.txt. Each file contains one thousand lines. Each line
 * 		contains a ranking, a boy’s name, number for the boy’s name, a girl’s name,
 * 		and number for the girl’s name. For example, the first two lines in the file
 * 		babynameranking2010.txt are as follows:
 * 
 * 		1  	Jacob 	21,875 	Isabella 	22,731
 * 		2	Ethan 	17,866 	Sophia 		20,477
 * 
 * 		So, the boy’s name Jacob and girl’s name Isabella are ranked #1 and the boy’s
 * 		name Ethan and girl’s name Sophia are ranked #2. 21,875 boys are named
 * 		Jacob and 22,731 girls are named Isabella. Write a program that prompts the
 * 		user to enter the year, gender, and followed by a name, and displays the ranking
 * 		of the name for the year. Here is a sample run:
 *

 * 		Enter the year: 2010
 * 		Enter the gender: M
 * 		Enter the name: Javier
 * 		Javier is ranked #190 in year 2010
 * 
 * 		Enter the year: 2010

 * 		Enter the name: ABC

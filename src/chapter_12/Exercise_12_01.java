/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 		
 * 		(NumberFormatException) Listing 7.9, Calculator.java, is a simple commandline
 * 		calculator. Note that the program terminates if any operand is nonnumeric.
 * 		Write a program with an exception handler that deals with nonnumeric operands;
 * 		then write another program without using an exception handler to achieve the
 * 		same objective. Your program should display a message that informs the user of
 * 		the wrong operand type before exiting (see Figure 12.12).
 * 
 * 
 * 	FIGURE 12.12 The program performs arithmetic operations and detects input errors.

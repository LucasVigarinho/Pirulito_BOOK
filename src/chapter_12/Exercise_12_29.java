/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(Rename files) Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory named Exercisei_j,
 * 		where i and j are digits. Write a program that pads a 0 before j if j is a single
 * 		digit. For example, a file named Exercise2_1 in a directory will be renamed to
 * 		Exercise2_01. In Java, when you pass the symbol * from the command line,
 * 		it refers to all files in the directory (see Supplement III.V). Use the following
 * 		command to run your program.
 * 
 * 		java Exercise12_29 *

/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(Replace words) Suppose you have a lot of files in a directory that contain
 * 		words Exercisei_j, where i and j are digits. Write a program that pads a 0
 * 		before i if i is a single digit and 0 before j if j is a single digit. For example,
 * 		the word Exercise2_1 in a file will be replaced by Exercise02_01. In Java,
 * 		when you pass the symbol * from the command line, it refers to all files in
 * 		the directory (see Supplement III.V). Use the following command to run your
 * 		program.
 * 
 * 		java Exercise12_27 *

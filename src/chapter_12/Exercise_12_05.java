/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(IllegalTriangleException) Programming Exercise 11.1 defined the
 * 		Triangle class with three sides. In a triangle, the sum of any two sides is
 * 		greater than the other side. The Triangle class must adhere to this rule.
 * 		Create the IllegalTriangleException class, and modify the constructor
 * 		of the Triangle class to throw an IllegalTriangleException object if a
 * 		triangle is created with sides that violate the rule, as follows:
 * 
 * 		// Construct a triangle with the specified sides 
 * 		public Triangle(double side1, double side2, double side3)
 * 		throws IllegalTriangleException {
 * 		// Implement it
 * 		}
 *

/**    ************* Description of the Exercise_5_30 *************
 * 
 * 		(Financial application: compound value) Suppose you save $100 each month
 * 		into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. So, the monthly interest
 * 		rate is 0.05 / 12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account
 * 		becomes
 * 
 * 				100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
 * 		After the second month, the value in the account becomes
 * 				
 * 				(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
 * 		After the third month, the value in the account becomes
 * 		
 * 				
 * 				(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
 * 		and so on.
 * 
 * 		Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual
 * 		interest rate (e.g., 5), and the number of months (e.g., 6) and displays the amount
 * 		in the savings account after the given month

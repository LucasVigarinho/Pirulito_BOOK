/**    ************* Description of the Exercise_5_14 *************
 * 
 * 		(Compute the greatest common divisor) Another solution for Listing 5.9 to find
 * 		the greatest common divisor of two integers n1 and n2 is as follows: First find d
 * 		to be the minimum of n1 and n2, then check whether d, d-1, d-2, . . . , 2, or 1 is
 * 		a divisor for both n1 and n2 in this order. The first such common divisor is the
 * 		greatest common divisor for n1 and n2. Write a program that prompts the user to
 * 		enter two positive integers and displays the gcd.

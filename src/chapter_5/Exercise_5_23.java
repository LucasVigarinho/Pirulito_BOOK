 * 
 * 		(Demonstrate cancellation errors) A cancellation error occurs when you are
 * 		manipulating a very large number with a very small number. The large number
 * 		may cancel out the smaller number. For example, the result of 100000000.0 +
 * 		0.000000001 is equal to 100000000.0. To avoid cancellation errors and obtain
 * 		more accurate results, carefully select the order of computation. For example, in
 * 		computing the following series, you will obtain more accurate results by computing
 * 		from right to left rather than from left to right:
 * 
 *				1	 1          1
 * 			1 + -- + -- + ... + --
 *	 			2    3          n
 * 
 * 		 Write a program that compares the results of the summation of the preceding
 * 		series, computing from left to right and from right to left with n = 50000.

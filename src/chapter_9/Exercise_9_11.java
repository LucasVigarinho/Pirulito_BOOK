/** 
 * 			
 * 
 * 		(Algebra: 2 * 2 linear equations) Design a class named LinearEquation for a
 * 		2 * 2 system of linear equations:
 * 		ax + by = e
 * 		cx + dy = f
 * 		x =
 * 		ed - bf
 * 		ad - bc
 * 		y =
 * 		af - ec
 * 		ad - bc
 * 		The class contains:
 * 		■ Private data fields a, b, c, d, e, and f.
 * 		■ A constructor with the arguments for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
 * 		■ Six getter methods for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
 * 		■ A method named isSolvable() that returns true if ad - bc is not 0.
 * 		■ Methods getX() and getY() that return the solution for the equation.
 * 		Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
 * 		program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result.
 * 		If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.” See Programming
 * 		Exercise 3.3 for sample runs.

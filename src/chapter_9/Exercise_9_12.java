/** 
 * 			
 * 		(Geometry: intersecting point) Suppose two line segments intersect. The two endpoints
 * 		for the first line segment are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and for the second line
 * 		segment are (x3, y3) and (x4, y4). Write a program that prompts the user to enter
 * 		these four endpoints and displays the intersecting point. As discussed in Programming
 * 		Exercise 3.25, the intersecting point can be found by solving a linear equation.
 * 		Use the LinearEquation class in Programming Exercise 9.11 to solve this
 * 		equation. See Programming Exercise 3.25 for sample runs.

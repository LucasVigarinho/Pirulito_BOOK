/** 
 * 			
 * 		(Algebra: quadratic equations) Design a class named QuadraticEquation for
 * 		a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + x = 0. The class contains:
 * 		■ Private data fields a, b, and c that represent three coefficients.
 * 		■ A constructor for the arguments for a, b, and c.
 * 		■ Three getter methods for a, b, and c.
 * 		■ A method named getDiscriminant() that returns the discriminant, which is
 * 		b2 - 4ac.
 * 		■ The methods named getRoot1() and getRoot2() for returning two roots of
 * 		the equation
 * 		r1 =
 * 		-b + 2b2 - 4ac
 * 		2a
 * 		and r2 =
 * 		-b - 2b2 - 4ac
 * 		2a
 * 		These methods are useful only if the discriminant is nonnegative. Let these methods
 * 		return 0 if the discriminant is negative.
 * 		Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
 * 		program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the result
 * 		based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display the two roots. If
 * 		the discriminant is 0, display the one root. Otherwise, display “The equation has
 * 		no roots.” See Programming Exercise 3.1 for sample runs.

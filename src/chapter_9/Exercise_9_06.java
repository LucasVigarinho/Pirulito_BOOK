/** 
 * 			
 * 		(Stopwatch) Design a class named StopWatch. The class contains:
 * 		■ Private data fields startTime and endTime with getter methods.
 * 		■ A no-arg constructor that initializes startTime with the current time.
 * 		■ A method named start() that resets the startTime to the current time.
 * 		■ A method named stop() that sets the endTime to the current time.
 * 		■ A method named getElapsedTime() that returns the elapsed time for the
 * 		stopwatch in milliseconds.
 * 		Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
 * 		program that measures the execution time of sorting 100,000 numbers using
 * 		selection sort.

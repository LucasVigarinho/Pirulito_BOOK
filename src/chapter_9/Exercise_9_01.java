/** 
 * 			
 * 
 * 		(The Rectangle class) Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2,
 * 		design a class named Rectangle to represent a rectangle. The class contains:
 * 		■ Two double data fields named width and height that specify the width and
 * 		height of the rectangle. The default values are 1 for both width and height.
 * 		■ A no-arg constructor that creates a default rectangle.
 * 		■ A constructor that creates a rectangle with the specified width and height.
 * 		■ A method named getArea() that returns the area of this rectangle.
 * 		■ A method named getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter.
 * 		Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
 * 		program that creates two Rectangle objects—one with width 4 and height 40
 * 		and the other with width 3.5 and height 35.9. Display the width, height, area,
 * 		and perimeter of each rectangle in this order.

/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(Combine two lists) Write a method that returns the union of two array lists of
 * 		integers using the following header:
 * 
 * 		public static ArrayList<Integer> union(ArrayList<Integer> list1, ArrayList<Integer> list2)
 * 
 * 		For example, the union of two array lists {2, 3, 1, 5} and {3, 4, 6} is
 * 		{2, 3, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6}. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two lists,
 * 		each with five integers, and displays their union. The numbers are separated by
 * 		exactly one space in the output. Here is a sample run:
 * 
 * 		Enter five integers for list1: 3 5 45 4 3
 * 		Enter five integers for list2: 33 51 5 4 13
 * 		The combined list is 3 5 45 4 3 33 51 5 4 13

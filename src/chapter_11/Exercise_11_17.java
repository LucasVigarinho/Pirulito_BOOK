/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(Algebra: perfect square) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer
 * 		m and find the smallest integer n such that m * n is a perfect square. (Hint:
 * 		Store all smallest factors of m into an array list. n is the product of the factors that
 * 		appear an odd number of times in the array list. For example, consider m = 90,
 * 		store the factors 2, 3, 3, 5 in an array list. 2 and 5 appear an odd number of times
 * 		in the array list. So, n is 10.) Here are sample runs:
 * 
 * 
 * 		Enter an integer m: 1500
 * 		The smallest number n for m * n to be a perfect square is 15
 * 		m * n is 22500
 * 
 * 
 * 		Enter an integer m: 63
 * 		The smalle
 * 		st number n for m * n to be a perfect square is 7
 * 		m * n is 441

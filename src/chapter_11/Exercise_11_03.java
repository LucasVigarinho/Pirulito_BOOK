/**			EXERCISE DESCRIPTION 
 * 
 * 		(Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 9.7, the Account class was
 * 		defined to model a bank account. An account has the properties account number,
 * 		balance, annual interest rate, and date created, and methods to deposit and withdraw
 * 		funds. Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts. A checking
 * 		account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
 * 		
 * 		Draw the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them. Write
 * 		a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and
 * 		CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.

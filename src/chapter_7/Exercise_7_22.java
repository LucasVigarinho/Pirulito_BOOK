/** 
 * 		(Game: Eight Queens) The classic Eight Queens puzzle is to place eight queens
 * 		on a chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (i.e., no two queens
 * 		are on the same row, same column, or same diagonal). There are many possible
 * 		solutions. Write a program that displays one such solution. A sample output is
 * 		shown below:

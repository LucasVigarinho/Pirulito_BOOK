/** 
 * 
 * 		(Partition of a list) Write the following method that partitions the list using the
 * 		first element, called a pivot.
 * 
 * 		public static int partition(int[] list)
 * 
 * 		After the partition, the elements in the list are rearranged so that all the elements
 * 		before the pivot are less than or equal to the pivot and the elements after the pivot
 * 		are greater than the pivot. The method returns the index where the pivot is located
 * 		in the new list. For example, suppose the list is {5, 2, 9, 3, 6, 8}. After the partition,
 * 		the list becomes {3, 2, 5, 9, 6, 8}. Implement the method in a way that takes
 * 		at most list.length comparisons. Write a test program that prompts the user
 * 		to enter a list and displays the list after the partition. Here is a sample run. Note
 * 		that the first number in the input indicates the number of the elements in the list.
 * 		This number is not part of the list.
 * 		
 * 		Enter list: 8 10 1 5 16 61 9 11 1
 * 		After the partition, the list is 9 1 5 1 10 61 11 16

/** 
 * 		(Simulation: coupon collectorâ€™s problem) Coupon collector is a classic statistics
 * 		problem with many practical applications. The problem is to pick objects from
 * 		a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the
 * 		objects to be picked at least once. A variation of the problem is to pick cards from
 * 		a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed
 * 		before you see one of each suit. Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck
 * 		before picking another. Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed
 * 		to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked (it is possible a
 * 		card may be picked twice). Here is a sample run of the program:
 * 
 * 		Queen of Spades
 * 		5 of Clubs
 * 		Queen of Hearts
 * 		4 of Diamonds
 * 		Number of picks: 12

/** 
 * 		(Identical arrays) The arrays list1 and list2 are identical if they have the
 * 		same contents. Write a method that returns true if list1 and list2 are identical,
 * 		using the following header:
 * 
 * 		public static boolean equals(int[] list1, int[] list2)
 * 
 * 		Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two lists of integers and displays
 * 		whether the two are identical. Here are the sample runs. Note that the first
 * 		number in the input indicates the number of the elements in the list. This number
 * 		is not part of the list.
 * 		
 * 		Enter list1: 5 2 5 6 6 1
 * 		Enter list2: 5 5 2 6 1 6
 * 		Two lists are identical
 * 		
 * 		Enter list1: 5 5 5 6 6 1
 * 		Enter list2: 5 2 5 6 1 6
 * 		Two lists are not identical

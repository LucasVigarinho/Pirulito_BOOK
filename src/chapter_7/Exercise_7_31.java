 * 			into a new sorted list.
 * 
 * 			public static int[] merge(int[] list1, int[] list2)
 * 
 * 			Implement the method in a way that takes at most list1.length + list2.
 * 			length comparisons. Write a test program that prompts the user to enter two
 * 			sorted lists and displays the merged list. Here is a sample run. Note that the first
 * 			number in the input indicates the number of the elements in the list. This number
 * 			is not part of the list.
 * 		
 * 			Enter list1: 5 1 5 16 61 111
 * 			Enter list2: 4 2 4 5 6
 * 			The merged list is 1 2 4 5 5 6 16 61 111
